In this project, I crawled data from a UK-universities-ranking website and classified these universities by KMean algorithm

1. Crawled data from website: https://www.ukuni.net/universities

After crawling data, we had a table with 4 columns: 
  - Name: Name of universities
  - Satisfaction: satisfaction of students who study in these universities
  - Fees: tuiition at these universities
  - Ranking: ranking of these universities in UK
  - International: percent of international students in these universities
  
2. Classified universities by K means clustering
